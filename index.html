<blockquote>
<p>Atom is really beautiful and great.
One of my favorite features are snip-its. <br>
For example if you are editing HTML and you type in the words html and press space it will replace it with all of this:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<ul>
<li>[x] Is it <strong>Free</strong>?</li>
<li>[x] Is it <strong>easy</strong> to use?</li>
<li>[x] Is it <strong>customizable</strong>?</li>
<li>[x] Does it support a lot of <strong>languages</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Atom's easy of use will allow me to be very productive while keeping frustration minimal. <br>
While it's customization options will ensure it won't be absolete in the near future.</p>
<h2>2. NetBean</h2>

<p><a href="https://netbeans.org/"><strong>Download</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>PROS</strong> | <strong>CONS</strong>
:---:|:---:
out-of-box exprience  | amount of plug-ins
user friendly interface | not widly used
pretty stable | mostly used for java</p>
<h4>User reviews</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Although it's a good product, it has been through a number of major evolutionary stages. Its major advantages are that since it was a production from the very people who invented Java (Sun), it should in theory anticipate improvements to Java and support Java-specific features. To a certain degree, it does, although Sun could have done more, especially when it came to JavaBean development and JSFWSYWIG design, which are 2 aspects where NetBeans does have an edge on Eclipse to begin with. Because NetBeans doesn't attempt to be all things to all people, it does tend to provide better support for &quot;grunt&quot; development, whereas Eclipse is more my cup of tea, since I'm more prone to develop systems with multiple components interacting in complex ways and non-Java components.</p>

<li>[x] Is it <strong>Free</strong>?</li>
<li>[x] Is it <strong>easy</strong> to use?</li>
<li>[ ] Is it <strong>customizable</strong>?</li>
<li>[ ] Does it support a lot of <strong>languages</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<p>NetBean doesn't seem to have much support beyond Java. <br>
While there are still things lacking it might be worthwile in the future.</p>
<h2>3. Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p><img src="https://process.filestackapi.com/cache=expiry:max/4U4oFsrTA6gCeRprTowH" alt="VSC logo" /></p>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"><strong>Download</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>PROS</strong> | <strong>CONS</strong>
:---:|:---:
extension manager  | uses a lot of memory
debugger for chrome | limited search function
fast performance | lacks some languages</p>
<h4>User reviews</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall I was very impressed with VSCode, to the point that I've considered moving to it more permanently. I'm still yet to take that step to fully dive in, but I think it would be a nice holiday project to configure it to meet similar standards I am used to in Sublime. After that, I think I really could stick with it for longer. The Git integration and in-editor debugger are great features that I've struggled with in Sublime but worked almost immediately in VSCode.</p>

</ul>
<p>Visual Studio Code seems to be very popular and has a big community for support. <br>
I'll be giving it a try if ATOM doesn't work for me.</p>
